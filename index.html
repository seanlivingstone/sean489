            <p>I am currently a Senior (Last semester! *knock on wood*) here at Texas A&M, and this website is for my CSCE 489 class. One of the things
            that I am trying to accomplish before my time ends here at A&M, is to become as well rounded of a Computer Scientist as possible. Over the years I have
            spent a lot of time on the more typical things such as algorithms and design, but learning about different areas of CS can be really beneficial which is
            one of the main reasons that I am in this class currently.<br><br> A little bit more about me, I am a sports <strong>fanatic</strong> and am a fan of any Dallas sports team especially the Mavericks and the Cowboys. I am also very into music, so much so that I created a web application that checks the diversity of a person's music taste called <a href="https://diverseify.herokuapp.com/">Diverseify</a> (https://diverseify.herokuapp.com/) as well as being a member of the Texas A&M Chamber Orchestra where I play cello. I also have dabbled a little in producing some beats over this past summer.</p>
